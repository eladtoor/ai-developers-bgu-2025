**Q: How do I check my current internet speed?**
A: Visit speedtest.net or fast.com for accurate speed testing. For best results, connect directly to your modem with an Ethernet cable and close other applications during testing.

**Q: What's included in my monthly bill?**

**Q: Can I use my own modem/router?**

### Technical Support Questions

A: Slow speeds can result from various factors: outdated equipment, multiple devices using bandwidth, wireless interference, or network congestion. We can help diagnose the specific cause and provide solutions.

**Q: How often should I restart my modem?**
A: Generally, restarting your modem monthly helps maintain optimal performance. If you experience frequent issues, restarting can often resolve connectivity problems.

**Q: What's the difference between WiFi and internet?**
A: Internet is the connection to the outside world, while WiFi is the wireless signal that connects your devices to your modem/router. You can have internet without WiFi (using Ethernet cables), but WiFi requires internet to function.

**Q: How do I change my WiFi password?**

A: Standard installations typically take 2-4 hours. This includes equipment setup, connection testing, and basic configuration. Complex installations may take longer.

**Q: Do I need to be home for installation?**
A: Yes, an adult (18+) must be present during installation to provide access and sign necessary paperwork.

**Q: What should I do to prepare for installation?**
A: Clear the area around your desired installation location, ensure power outlets are available, and have your ID ready for verification.
