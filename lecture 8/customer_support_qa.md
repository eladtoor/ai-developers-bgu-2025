# Customer Support Q&A Database

## Connection Issues

**Q: My internet is completely down. What should I do first?**
A: Start by checking if there are any known outages in your area, verify your account status and payment history, and ensure your modem/router is powered on with all lights illuminated. If everything appears normal, try power cycling your modem/router by unplugging it for 30 seconds, then reconnecting it.

**Q: My internet is very slow. How can I test my speed?**
A: Visit speedtest.net or fast.com for accurate speed testing. For best results, connect directly to your modem with an Ethernet cable and close other applications during testing. Test on both wired and wireless connections to compare results.

**Q: My connection keeps dropping intermittently. What could be causing this?**
A: Intermittent connections can be caused by weather conditions, physical damage to cables, interference from other devices, or outdated equipment. Check if the drops occur at specific times, monitor your modem logs for error messages, and consider environmental factors like weather or nearby construction.

**Q: Why is my WiFi signal weak in certain areas of my home?**
A: WiFi signals can be weakened by walls, distance from the router, interference from other devices, or the router's placement. Try moving your router to a central location, change the wireless channel to avoid interference, or consider adding a WiFi extender for better coverage.

## Equipment Issues

**Q: My modem won't turn on. What should I check?**
A: First, check your power adapter and outlet. Try a different power source and replace the power adapter if necessary. If the equipment still won't power on, you may need to schedule an equipment replacement.

**Q: How often should I restart my modem?**
A: Generally, restarting your modem monthly helps maintain optimal performance. If you experience frequent issues, restarting can often resolve connectivity problems.

**Q: Can I use my own modem/router instead of the company's equipment?**
A: Yes, you can use compatible equipment. We provide a list of approved modems on our website. Using your own equipment may reduce monthly fees, but you'll be responsible for troubleshooting equipment issues.

**Q: How do I change my WiFi password?**
A: Access your router's settings by typing the IP address (usually 192.168.1.1) in your browser. Log in with your router credentials and navigate to the wireless settings section to change your password.

## Speed and Performance

**Q: What internet speeds do you offer?**
A: We offer various speed tiers ranging from 25 Mbps to 1 Gbps. The available speeds depend on your location and infrastructure. We can check what's available at your address and recommend the best option for your needs.

**Q: Why is my internet slower than advertised speeds?**
A: Slow speeds can result from various factors: outdated equipment, multiple devices using bandwidth, wireless interference, or network congestion. We can help diagnose the specific cause and provide solutions.

**Q: What's the difference between WiFi and internet?**
A: Internet is the connection to the outside world, while WiFi is the wireless signal that connects your devices to your modem/router. You can have internet without WiFi (using Ethernet cables), but WiFi requires internet to function.

**Q: How can I improve my internet speed?**
A: Try connecting directly to your modem with an Ethernet cable, close unnecessary applications, check for firmware updates on your equipment, and ensure your modem/router supports your plan's speeds. Consider upgrading equipment if it's outdated.
